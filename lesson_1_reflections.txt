How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It can show you which lines were added/removed and it will only show what has changed.

Awesome!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can see what had changed, you can compare code.  Not make the same mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

If you forget to commit.  GONE

Git has more logical commit points and can give reasons for those commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

purpose of the version control system...google docs is for single documents...code can reference multiple files that are co-dependant

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives you id/times/commit note
git diff firstid seccondid tells you which lines were added/deleted with +/-

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
it can easily revert and see what changed with git diff

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
EVERYTING!  YEAH!
